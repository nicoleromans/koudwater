                    <p> Joseph Hill (22 January 1949 â€“ 19 August 2006) was the lead singer and songwriter for the roots reggae group Culture, most famous for their 1977 hit "Two Sevens Clash", but also well known for their "International Herb" single. Hill recorded twenty-two albums.

The record was hugely popular on the emerging punk rock scene in England, heavily influencing The Clash, John Lydon and Public Image.[citation needed]

                    During the 1970s the group had a string of highly successful singles for producers Joe Gibbs and Sonia Pottinger including the song "Two Sevens Clash" which made its mark on both Jamaica and the United Kingdom. It was named by Rolling Stone magazine in 2002 as one of the "50 Coolest Records", the only single artist reggae album to make the list. The group also had a hit with "Stop Fussing and Fighting", a song that addressed the chaotic political climate of the late 1970s and the attempt on Bob Marley's life.
                    
                    Joseph Hill and Culture developed a reputation as a performing group after a performance at the One Love Peace Concert in 1978, and was soon regularly touring the United States, Europe and Africa. In recent years the group continued to perform at least one hundred concerts each year, with Hill's wife Pauline as road manager. Hill was a presence on stage: part DJ as he directed his band to reconfigure songs on stage and part teacher as he commented on Jamaican history and current political issues. In his lyrics, Hill often explored how the legacy of slavery continued to have an influence on Jamaican citizens.

In 2005 he received the Culture Shock Bronze Medal in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican music.[5]
                    
                    As a member of the Rastafari movement, Joseph Hill was a worshipper of emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. Indeed, Hill's honorific/nickname, "Keeper of Zion Gate" reflects his position as one of reggae's and Rastafari's greatest voices.[6]</p>
